      Sustainability: Management of natural resources and Environment with the goals of allowing harvest of resources to remain at or above a specified level so the ecosystem can retain its structure and function.

      Model: A deliberately simplified explanation, typically physical, that serves a functional purpose, and <b>does not merely "look good"</b>.
    </p>
    <p id=a4>
      Scientific Method: A system by which scientists investigate natural phenomena, but which falls short of many questions in environmental science because it deals with very complex systems for which it is impossible to have a control group, and therefore very difficult to gather data in that manner. 
    </p>
    <p id=a5>
      TOTC: An infinite cycle of space and/or resources shared without rules, with individual benefit and shared cost, ultimately resulting in resource degradation or destruction.
